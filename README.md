## Introduction

> **Orbital Pool isn‚Äôt just another AMM, it‚Äôs a paradigm shift. The future holds a million stablecoins. Today's infrastructure isn't ready.**

Orbital is an automated market maker for pools of 2, 3, or 10,000 stablecoins. It unlocks capital efficiency by bringing concentrated liquidity to higher dimensions.

By bending liquidity into a torus-shaped universe, Orbital unlocks concentrated liquidity for three or more stablecoins at once. This isn‚Äôt your usual 2D liquidity grid‚Äîit‚Äôs an entirely new dimension where LPs can laser-focus around the sacred $1 mark, while still guaranteeing fair prices even if an entire stablecoin implodes to zero.

It‚Äôs like Uniswap V3‚Äôs surgical precision colliding head-on with Curve‚Äôs bulletproof stability, and the result is something that shouldn‚Äôt even exist, but somehow, it does.

Orbital is the AMM where capital efficiency doesn‚Äôt just scale, it warps!

## Key Features

- **Multi-Token Stability Engine**: Seamlessly trade across three or more stablecoins in a single pool with no more fragmented liquidity.

- **Warped Concentrated Liquidity**: Liquidity providers can laser-focus capital around $1, achieving maximum efficiency while still keeping markets resilient.

- **Torus Invariant Model**: A breakthrough mathematical invariant that curves liquidity across dimensions, ensuring fair pricing even in extreme scenarios.

- **Fusion of Giants (Uniswap √ó Curve)**: Orbital takes Uniswap V3‚Äôs precision and Curve‚Äôs stability, merging them into a next-generation AMM.

## Mathematical Foundation

### The Orbital Model

The Orbital AMM is built on the mathematical foundation described in the [Paradigm Orbital Whitepaper](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2025/06/orbital). The core innovation lies in extending concentrated liquidity to higher dimensions using spherical geometry.

#### Core Mathematical Concepts

**1. Sphere AMM Formula**

<img src="public/orbital_equation.jpg" width="400" alt="Orbital Equation" /> 

Where:
- `r(vector) = (r, r, ..., r)` vector is the center of the sphere
- `x·µ¢` is the AMM's reserve of asset i
- `r` is the radius of the sphere

**2. Torus Invariant**

The pool uses a torus (donut-shaped) invariant that combines:
- **Interior Ticks**: Behave like spheres for normal trading
- **Boundary Ticks**: Behave like circles when reserves hit boundaries

**4. Tick Geometry**

Each tick is defined by:
- **k**: Plane constant (tick identifier)
- **r**: Radius of the tick
- **Status**: Interior or Boundary

#### K-Value Validation

The k-value must satisfy the constraint:
```
k ‚â• (r √ó PRECISION) / SQRT5_SCALED
```

Where:
- `PRECISION = 1e15`
- `SQRT5_SCALED = 2236067977499790`

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Foundry installed
- Node.js 16+ (for testing)
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/orbital-pool.git
cd orbital-pool

# Install dependencies
forge install

# Build the project
forge build

# Run tests
forge test
```

### Steps to configure your own pool

```bash
# Deploy pool and the mock tokens
forge script script/DeployAndConfig.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast

# Command to add liqudity
cast send $POOL_ADDRESS "addLiquidity(uint256,uint256[5])" 3000000000000000 "[1000000000000000000000,1000000000000000000000,1000000000000000000000,1000000000000000000000,1000000000000000000000]" --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

# Command to swap 
cast send $POOL_ADDRESS "swap(uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256)" 0 1 20000000000000000000 0 --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Frontend installation

#### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

#### Environment Variables

To deploy the smart contracts, you'll need to set up a .env file in the root directory to store your private key and network credentials.

Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the project's root directory. Copy the contents of .env.example and replace the placeholder values with your own information.

.env.example

PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
SOMNIA_RPC_URL="https://rpc.somnia.network"
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="..."
PRIVATE_KEY: The private key of the account you want to use for deployment. Never commit this file to a public repository.

SOMNIA_RPC_URL: The RPC endpoint for the network you're deploying to (e.g., Somnia's testnet or mainnet).

ETHERSCAN_API_KEY: Your Etherscan API key, which is required for automatic contract verification during deployment.


All contract addresses are pre-configured for Somnia testnet.
